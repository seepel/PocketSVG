# PocketSVG

## Command Line Tool

This is a quick and dirty hack that I made to this repository to create a command line utility that given an SVG file will spit out the code needed to create a corresponding UIBezierPath. This is useful if you want to start from an SVG file, but modify the control points to suit your needs. For example adding control points or moving them around so you can line up two SVG files for Core Animation to animate smoothly between the two.

## Begin Original README
An Objective-C class that converts Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) into:
* CGPaths
* CAShapeLayers
* UIBezierPaths
* NSBezierCurves 

This makes it easy to create vector-based paths and shapes in your iOS or OS X apps. 

Feedback, improvements, and pull requests are welcome.

## Usage
1. Make your drawing in a vector graphics editor such as Illustrator, Inkscape, [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), etc.
1. Save as an SVG.
1. Drag and drop it into your Xcode project.
1. Follow these easy steps:

```obj-c
    //1: Create a PocketSVG object from your SVG file:
    PocketSVG *myVectorDrawing = [[PocketSVG alloc] initFromSVGFileNamed:@"BezierCurve3"];
    
    //2: Its bezier property is the corresponding UIBezierPath:
    UIBezierPath *myBezierPath = myVectorDrawing.bezier;
    
    //3: To display it on screen, create a CAShapeLayer and set 
    //the CGPath property of the above UIBezierPath as its 
    //path. 
    CAShapeLayer *myShapeLayer = [CAShapeLayer layer];
    myShapeLayer.path = myBezierPath.CGPath;
    
    //4: Fiddle with it using CAShapeLayer's properties:
    myShapeLayer.strokeColor = [[UIColor redColor] CGColor];
    myShapeLayer.lineWidth = 4;
    myShapeLayer.fillColor = [[UIColor clearColor] CGColor];
    
    //5: Display it!
    [self.view.layer addSublayer:myShapeLayer];
```
Don't forget to add the __QuartzCore__ framework to your project ([here's how](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3377682/1072846)) and import it:
```obj-c
#import <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>
```

## Useful Documentation
* [An SVG's d attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathElement) â€“ from the SVG specification 
* [UIBezierPaths](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html) - Class Reference 
* [CAShapeLayers](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CAShapeLayer_class/Reference/Reference.html) - Class Reference. Tells you which properties of the shape/path can be manipulated. 
* [Drawing Shapes Using Bezier Paths](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/2ddrawing/conceptual/drawingprintingios/BezierPaths/BezierPaths.html) - From Apple's Drawing and Printing Guide for iOS

## Latest Fixes
* Added support for NSBezierPaths (thanks to [mcianni](https://github.com/mcianni)).
* Fixed problem that causes SVGs to render with wrong frame dimensions.
* Fixed problem that causes some SVGs to render incorrectly.
* Fixed parse bug for SVGs with blank spaces in them (thanks to [mindbrix](https://github.com/mindbrix)).
* Simplified PocketSVG's init method (thanks to [johnnyknox](https://github.com/johnnyknox)).

## To Do
* Support for SVG's [Basic Shapes](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/shapes.html).
* Support for SVGs with more than one path (currently PocketSVG renders the last path).
* Improve parser efficiency.
* Make it a category on CAShapeLayer?
